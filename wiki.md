## Project Overview
Use mmW Radar to determine hand gestures to control HID as a mouse to interact with PC interface
### Performance Indicator:
In order to assess the performance of the project, 5 key indicators are used:
- Accuracy of mmW Radar reading
- Accuracy of gesture recognition
- Accuracy in receive HID protocol from PC
- Data transmission rate
- M5Core2 ables to configurate and display gesture captured in reasonable manner
